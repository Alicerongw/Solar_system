Purpose
-------

This project serves as a starting point for the PHAS0100 Assignment 2 Gravitational N-body Simulation coursework. It has a reasonable folder structure for [CMake](https://cmake.org/) based projects,
that use [CTest](https://cmake.org/) to run unit tests via [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). 

Further information on the specific project is left as an exercise for the student.


Credits
-------

This project is maintained by [Dr. Jim Dobson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jim-dobson). It is based on [CMakeCatch2](https://github.com/UCL/CMakeCatch2.git) that was originally developed as a teaching aid for UCL's ["Research Computing with C++"](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/research-computing-with-cpp/)
course developed by [Dr. James Hetherington](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/people/james)
and [Dr. Matt Clarkson](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42).


Build Instructions
------------------

Ensure that  a "out-of-source" build is made.

Detailed of "out-of-source" build is shown below:

<br/>(1): Make sure that you are in the PHAS0100ASSIGNMENT2 directory<br/>  
<br/>(2): **mkdir** build (or skip this step if you have created this directory before)<br/>
<br/>(3): **cd build**<br/>
<br/>(4): **cmake ..  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release** if you want to toggle off all std::cout, which is for the benchmarking<br/>
<br/>(5): Or **cmake ..  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug** if you want to toggle on all std::cout, which is for outputing r_com and p_total to screen as the simulation evolves<br/>
<br/>(6): **make**<br/>



Command line Instructions
------------------
After all these five steps, you can now run the command line app from the build directory and pass the step_size and the number of timesteps when invoking the command like this syntax:

<br/>a): **solarSystemSimulator [-s  step_size for the simulation] [-n  number of timesteps]**<br/>
<br/>b): **solarSystemSimulator [--stepsize  step_size for the simulation] [--number number of timesteps]**<br/>

Instruction may be like:
<br/>a): **./bin/solarSystemSimulator -s 0.000274 -n 3650**<br/>
<br/>b): **./bin/solarSystemSimulator -s 0.0000274 -n 36500**<br/>


Unit test Instructions
------------------
Apart from command line app, you can also run the unit tests for this project. Instructions for unit test: **./bin/nbsimSolarSystemSimulationTests**. Or you could also simplely run **ctest** in the build directory.



Benchmark
------------------
<br/>Remember using **cmake ..  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release** to toggle off all std::cout<br/>

Benchmark the time that takes simulation to run for 1 year‚Äôs worth of simulated time and for
seven different timestep sizes. The detailed summary is listed below

<br/>From previous seven different step_sizes, comparing with known position of earth after one year simulation ùíìùê∏ùëéùëüùë°‚Ñé = (‚àí0.194, 0.969, 0.000109), it is clear that timestep greater than 1 minute would cause significant bias for position of earth after one year's simulation. Consideing the balance between simulation run time and accuracy, the timestep setting to 1 second (0.00000003171 year) will be reasonable. <br/>



OPENMP Parallelism
------------------
The choosed timestep is 1 second (0.00000003171 year) and the number of timestep is 31536000

It can be seen from above results that the running time of simulation increases as the thread increasing. In this case, Parallelism don't help to reduce the running time of the simulation.
The main reason of this may due to that the interations in for loop are limited. For creation of each
thread, it takes time and resources. If the running time of for loop in single thread is short, then the creation of multiple threads will have overhead and take more time than expected. Besides, switching between different threads also takes time. The result may vary between different systems.
